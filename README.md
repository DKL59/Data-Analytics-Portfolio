## 🔍 Data Preparation
The raw dataset contained customer, product, and marketing information.  
Key cleaning steps in **Excel**:

- Used the `TRIM()` function to remove blank spaces in headers.  
- Renamed unclear columns based on metadata.  
- Standardized country abbreviations (`SP` → `ESP`, `SA` → `RSA`).  
- Converted income and date columns from text to numeric/date types.  
- Removed three invalid records (ages beyond the oldest known human).  
- Calculated customer ages using **2024** as the base year.  
- Imported the final cleaned dataset (**2,213 records**) into **PostgreSQL** for further analysis.
